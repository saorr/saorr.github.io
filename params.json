I am a Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA) intern. I work primarily with WonderWare and help optimize existing code on wind turbines. Last summer I earned my Six Sigma yellow belt, redesigned a site SCADA screen and added expected state logic - which double checks that commands sent are actually received and completed. This job taught me to take advantage of things that are given to you since they might be more valuable than they appear. I hope to learn more this upcoming summer. \r\n\r\n- [ArcSine Engineering:](http://www.arc-sine.com/) As an intern summer 2014 and summer 2013. This was my first internship and involved basic engineering tasks such as reading and generating technical specifications and drawing; learning the basics of SCADA; small scale wind turbine feasibility and energy impact test; and code review, including the National Fire Protection Association codes and the National Electric Code. This job taught me how to take care of myself which made me appreciate the help I've gotten from my parents even more. \r\n\r\n- [Oakhurst Country Club:](http://www.oakhurstcc.com/) This was my first real job, I was a lifeguard, swim coach, and a junior tennis pro in high school. I got this job because I played tennis for the resident pro and was his team captain my junior and senior years of high school. Really what I learned from working here was how important it is to find something you love to do for your job, because that is what you spend most of your time doing. \r\n\r\n### Technical Things I Can Do\r\n- Program in Excel and am computer literate in the Microsoft Suite\r\n- Design an electrical amplifier or transformer\r\n- C and WonderWare programming skills\r\n- Solve problems using creative and critical thinking\r\n- Solve problems efficiently\r\n\r\n### Other Stuff I Can Do:\r\n- Be a team leader and a team member\r\n- Communicate with others\r\n- Identify specific end goals\r\n- Function well in stressful situations\r\n\r\n### Communities I am Currently a Member of\r\n- [ECE Ambassador:](http://www.ece.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/ambassador) Basically volunteer around the electrical and computer engineering department by leading tours and working (organizing, setting up, cleaning up, improving) unique community building and student focused events events.\r\n- [SheJumps:](http://shejumps.com/) Getting into this one more recently, it is an awesome site where you can connect with women relatively near you who do outdoor sports, like mountain biking, skiing, surfing - basically sports pioneered by men that are intimidating for anybody to get into. \r\n\r\n### Fun Stuff I Do\r\n- Skiing\r\n- Mountain biking\r\n- Road biking\r\n- Frisbee Golfing\r\n- Kayaking/Canoeing\r\n- Reading\r\n- DIY Projects\r\n- Driving\r\n\r\n### My Favorite Stuff\r\n- Cooking\r\n- Eating good food with friends\r\n- Hamburgers\r\n- Relaxing\r\n- Movies",
