<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nexteraenergy.com/index.shtml">NextEra Energy Resources:</a> As an intern in summer of 2015 and returning summer 2016. I am a Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA) intern. I work primarily with WonderWare and help optimize existing code on wind turbines. Last summer I earned my Six Sigma yellow belt, redesigned a site SCADA screen and added expected state logic - which double checks that commands sent are actually received and completed. This job taught me to take advantage of things that are given to you since they might be more valuable than they appear. I hope to learn more this upcoming summer. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.arc-sine.com/">ArcSine Engineering:</a> As an intern summer 2014 and summer 2013. This was my first internship and involved basic engineering tasks such as reading and generating technical specifications and drawing; learning the basics of SCADA; small scale wind turbine feasibility and energy impact test; and code review, including the National Fire Protection Association codes and the National Electric Code. This job taught me how to take care of myself which made me appreciate the help I've gotten from my parents even more. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.oakhurstcc.com/">Oakhurst Country Club:</a> This was my first real job, I was a lifeguard, swim coach, and a junior tennis pro in high school. I got this job because I played tennis for the resident pro and was his team captain my junior and senior years of high school. Really what I learned from working here was how important it is to find something you love to do for your job, because that is what you spend most of your time doing. </p></li>
